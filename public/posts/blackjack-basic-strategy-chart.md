If you want to win at blackjack—or at least lose less—you need to know basic strategy. This mathematically proven system reduces the house edge from 2-4% down to just **0.5%**, making blackjack one of the best casino games for players.

In this guide, you'll get a complete blackjack basic strategy chart, learn how to read it, understand when to hit, stand, double, or split, and discover memorization techniques that work. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refine your game, this is your complete resource.

**Ready to play perfect blackjack?** Let's dive in.

## What is Blackjack Basic Strategy?

Basic strategy is a **mathematically optimal way to play every possible hand** in blackjack. It's based on computer simulations that calculated the expected value of every decision (hit, stand, double, split) for every possible player hand versus every possible dealer upcard.

### Why Basic Strategy Works

Blackjack has **fixed rules** that never change:
- Dealer must hit on 16 or less
- Dealer must stand on 17 or more
- Player acts first (and loses if they bust, even if dealer also busts)
- Specific card values (Ace = 1 or 11, Face cards = 10, etc.)

Because the rules are fixed, mathematicians can calculate the **optimal decision** for every situation. Follow basic strategy perfectly, and you'll play with only a 0.5% house edge—better than almost any other casino game.

### Basic Strategy vs. Gut Feeling

Here's why you need the chart:

| Decision Method | House Edge | $100 Loss per Hour* |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Random guessing | ~5% | $25-30 |
| "Gut feeling" plays | ~2-4% | $10-20 |
| **Basic strategy** | **~0.5%** | **$2.50** |
| Basic strategy + counting | -1% (player edge!) | +$5 (profit) |

*Assumes 50 hands per hour at $50 average bet

**The difference between guessing and basic strategy?** About $27.50 per hour. Over a weekend trip (10 hours of play), that's **$275 saved** just by using the chart.

## The Complete Basic Strategy Chart

Here's the full basic strategy chart for the most common rules (6-8 decks, dealer stands on soft 17, double after split allowed, late surrender allowed):

## How to Read the Basic Strategy Chart

The chart looks complex, but it's actually simple once you understand the structure:

### Step 1: Find Your Hand Total
Look at the **left column** to find your hand total:
- **Hard totals** - No Ace or Ace counted as 1 (e.g., 10+6=16)
- **Soft totals** - Ace counted as 11 (e.g., A+6=17)
- **Pairs** - Two cards of the same rank (e.g., 8+8)

### Step 2: Find the Dealer's Upcard
Look at the **top row** to find what the dealer is showing (2 through Ace).

### Step 3: Find the Intersection
Where your row and the dealer's column meet tells you the optimal play.

### Example Walkthrough

**Scenario 1: You have 16, dealer shows 10**
1. Find "16" in the Hard Totals section
2. Move across to the "10" column
3. Result: **SU** (Surrender if allowed, otherwise Hit)

Why? With 16 vs. 10, you'll bust about 62% of the time if you hit. The dealer has a strong hand (10 showing). Surrendering loses half your bet but saves you money compared to playing the hand out.

**Scenario 2: You have A,7 (soft 18), dealer shows 6**
1. Find "A,7" in the Soft Totals section
2. Move across to the "6" column  
3. Result: **DS** (Double if allowed, otherwise Stand)

Why? Dealer has a weak card (6) and will bust about 42% of the time. Your soft 18 can't bust on one hit, so doubling down when the dealer is weak maximizes your expected value.

**Scenario 3: You have 8,8, dealer shows 9**
1. Find "8,8" in the Pairs section
2. Move across to the "9" column
3. Result: **SP** (Split)

Why? 16 is a terrible hand. Splitting 8s gives you two chances to make 18 (a decent hand). Never play 16 as a hard total when you can split 8s.

## Hard Hands Strategy Explained

Hard hands are any hand **without an Ace** or where the Ace must count as 1 to avoid busting.

### The Golden Rules for Hard Hands:

**Always stand on 17 or higher**
- Never hit 17-21 (you'll bust too often)
- Even against dealer Ace—stand on hard 17+

**Hit 12-16 against strong dealer cards (7-Ace)**
- Dealer strong cards = must take risk of busting
- Exception: Surrender 15-16 vs. dealer 10 or Ace if allowed

**Stand 12-16 against weak dealer cards (2-6)**
- Dealer likely to bust—let them take the risk
- Exception: Always hit 12 vs. dealer 2 or 3

**Always double 11**
- 11 is the best doubling hand
- You can't bust, and you'll make 21 about 31% of the time

**Double 10 against dealer 2-9**
- Don't double against dealer 10 or Ace
- Strong hand that benefits from doubling

**Double 9 against dealer 3-6**
- Only double when dealer is weak
- Hit against stronger dealer cards

### Why These Rules Work: The Math

Let's look at dealer bust rates by upcard:

| Dealer Upcard | Bust Rate | Why This Matters |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| 2 | 35.3% | Weakish—but not weak enough for 12 |
| 3 | 37.6% | Slightly weaker than 2 |
| 4 | 40.3% | Weak—stand on 12+ |
| 5 | 42.9% | Very weak—double aggressively |
| 6 | 42.1% | Very weak—double aggressively |
| 7 | 26.2% | Strong—must be aggressive |
| 8 | 23.9% | Strong—must be aggressive |
| 9 | 23.3% | Strong—must be aggressive |
| 10 | 23.0% | Very strong—consider surrender |
| A | 11.7% | Strongest—consider surrender |

When the dealer shows 5 or 6, they bust **over 42% of the time**. This is why basic strategy has you stand on weaker hands and double more aggressively.

## Soft Hands Strategy Explained

Soft hands contain an Ace counted as 11. The beauty of soft hands? **You can't bust on the next card.**

### Key Soft Hand Rules:

**Always split Aces**
- Split A,A every time (see pairs section)
- Each Ace becomes a new hand with potential for 21

**Stand on soft 19 (A,8) and soft 20 (A,9)**
- These are strong hands—don't risk them

**Soft 18 (A,7) is tricky**
- Double vs. dealer 2-6 (dealer weak)
- Stand vs. dealer 7-8 (decent hand)
- Hit vs. dealer 9, 10, A (your 18 isn't strong enough)

**Always hit soft 17 (A,6) or less**
- You can't bust—take a free card
- Double vs. dealer 4-6 if allowed

**Soft 15-16 (A,4 or A,5)**
- Double vs. dealer 4-6
- Hit otherwise

**Soft 13-14 (A,2 or A,3)**
- Double vs. dealer 5-6 only
- Hit otherwise

### Common Soft Hand Mistakes

❌ **Standing on soft 17**
- Many players stand on A,6 thinking "I have 17"
- This is wrong! Always hit soft 17

❌ **Not doubling soft 18 vs. weak dealer cards**
- Soft 18 is decent but not great
- When dealer shows 5 or 6, double down

❌ **Being scared to hit soft hands**
- You literally can't bust on one card
- Always take that free opportunity

## Pair Splitting Strategy Explained

Splitting creates two separate hands from a pair and requires an additional bet equal to your original wager.

### Universal Splitting Rules:

**ALWAYS split Aces and 8s**
- **Aces**: Two chances at 21. Never play A,A as 12.
- **8s**: Splits 16 (worst hand) into two 18s (decent hands)

**NEVER split 10s, 5s, or 4s**
- **10s**: 20 is too strong to risk—just stand
- **5s**: 10 is a great doubling hand—double instead
- **4s**: 8 is decent—hitting is better than two weak hands starting at 4

**Split 9s vs. dealer 2-9 (except 7)**
- Don't split vs. dealer 7 (your 18 beats dealer's likely 17)
- Don't split vs. dealer 10 or A (too strong)

**Split 2s, 3s, 6s, and 7s vs. dealer 2-7**
- Split when dealer is weak/medium
- Don't split against strong dealer cards

### The Logic Behind Pair Splits

**Why always split Aces?**
- A,A as "12" is terrible (can't even get 21 on one hit)
- Two hands starting with Ace gives you two shots at 21
- Even if you get 21 after splitting Aces (some casinos limit this), it's still better than playing 12

**Why always split 8s?**
- 16 is the worst possible total in blackjack
- Expected value of 16 vs. dealer 10 = lose about 54% of bet
- Expected value of split 8s vs. dealer 10 = lose about 48% of bet
- You still lose on average, but you lose less

**Why never split 10s?**
- 20 wins or pushes about 88% of the time
- Splitting turns one great hand into two good hands
- The math doesn't support it (even though you'd win some splits)

## How to Memorize Basic Strategy

Don't try to memorize the entire chart at once. Instead, learn it in sections:

### Week 1: Hard Totals
Focus only on hard hands:
- Always stand on 17+
- Stand 12-16 vs. dealer 2-6
- Hit 12-16 vs. dealer 7-A
- Always double 11
- Practice 30 minutes daily

### Week 2: Soft Totals
Add soft hands to your practice:
- Soft hands can't bust on one card
- Hit soft 17 or less
- Soft 18 depends on dealer card
- Practice combined with hard hands

### Week 3: Pairs
Add pair splitting:
- Memorize the "always" and "never" splits first
- Learn the conditional splits (2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 9s)
- Practice all three sections together

### Week 4: Perfect Play
Polish your skills:
- Practice with distractions
- Speed up your decisions
- Train with real cards or apps

### Memory Tricks

**Rhymes and phrases:**
- "Always split Aces and 8s, never 10s, 5s, or 4s"
- "Soft 17 or less? Always guess!" (hit)
- "Weak dealer? Double down!" (dealer 4-6)

**Visual patterns:**
- Hard hands: diagonal line where standing starts
- Soft hands: lots of doubling against 4-6
- Pairs: bookends (always split A,8 / never split 10,5,4)

**Muscle memory:**
- Practice with physical cards
- Deal yourself hands and make decisions
- Repeat until automatic

## Basic Strategy by Game Variations

Basic strategy changes slightly based on specific rules. Here are the most important variations:

### Number of Decks

| Rule | House Edge Impact | Strategy Adjustment |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Single deck | -0.02% (better) | More favorable pair splits |
| Double deck | -0.035% (better) | Slightly more aggressive |
| 6-8 decks | Baseline (0.5%) | Use chart above |

### Dealer Hits Soft 17 (H17)

If the dealer hits soft 17 instead of standing:
- House edge increases by +0.2%
- **Adjust**: Double A,8 vs. dealer 6 (instead of standing)
- **Adjust**: Double A,7 vs. dealer 2 (instead of standing)

### Double After Split (DAS)

If you can double down after splitting pairs:
- House edge decreases by -0.15% (better for player)
- **Adjust**: Split 2s and 3s vs. dealer 2-3 (more aggressive)
- **Adjust**: Split 6s vs. dealer 2 (more aggressive)

### Surrender Rules

**Early surrender** (before dealer checks for blackjack):
- Very rare, reduces house edge by -0.60%
- Surrender 16 vs. dealer 9, 10, A
- Surrender 15 vs. dealer 10

**Late surrender** (after dealer checks for blackjack):
- More common, reduces house edge by -0.08%
- Surrender 16 vs. dealer 9, 10, A
- Surrender 15 vs. dealer 10
- Already in the chart above

## Common Basic Strategy Mistakes

Even with the chart, players make these errors:

### Mistake #1: Playing Hunches
**Wrong**: "I feel like the dealer will bust, so I'll stand on 12 vs. dealer 10"
**Right**: Always follow the chart—your feelings don't change the math

### Mistake #2: Insuring a Good Hand
**Wrong**: Taking insurance when you have 20
**Right**: Insurance is mathematically bad (house edge ~7%) unless you're counting cards

### Mistake #3: Not Doubling When You Should
**Wrong**: Hitting 11 vs. dealer 6 instead of doubling
**Right**: Missing double opportunities costs you money

### Mistake #4: Splitting 10s
**Wrong**: Splitting 10s because the dealer has a weak card
**Right**: 20 is too strong—always keep it

### Mistake #5: Standing on Soft 17
**Wrong**: Standing on A,6 thinking "I have 17"
**Right**: Always hit soft 17—you can't bust

### Mistake #6: Not Splitting 8s vs. Strong Cards
**Wrong**: Standing on 16 (8,8) vs. dealer 10 because "splitting is risky"
**Right**: Split 8s ALWAYS—even vs. dealer Ace

### Mistake #7: Playing 12 vs. Dealer 2-3 Wrong
**Wrong**: Standing on 12 vs. dealer 2 or 3
**Right**: Hit 12 vs. dealer 2 or 3 (they're not weak enough)

## Beyond Basic Strategy: Next Steps

Once you've mastered basic strategy (95%+ accuracy), you can explore advantage play:

### Card Counting
- Adds 1-2% player edge on top of basic strategy
- Requires 100+ hours of practice
- Legal but casinos don't like it
- See our guide: [How to Count Cards in Blackjack](/blog/how-to-count-cards-in-blackjack)

### Composition-Dependent Strategy
- Slightly more accurate than basic strategy
- Considers specific card composition, not just total
- Adds about 0.02% edge
- Very complex to learn

### Team Play
- Multiple players working together
- Can spread more money and avoid detection
- Requires coordination and trust
- Made famous by the MIT Blackjack Team

## Blackjack Basic Strategy FAQ

### How long does it take to learn basic strategy?
Most players can learn the basics in 2-4 weeks with 30 minutes of daily practice. Perfect execution under pressure takes 2-3 months.

### Do I need to memorize the entire chart?
Yes, for optimal play. However, memorizing just the most common situations (hard totals 12-17, soft totals, always/never splits) gets you 90% of the way there.

### Can I bring a strategy chart to the casino?
Yes! Most casinos allow basic strategy cards at the table. They know it only reduces the house edge to 0.5%—still in their favor.

### Does basic strategy guarantee I'll win?
No. Basic strategy minimizes the house edge but doesn't eliminate it. In the short term, variance is huge. Long term, you'll lose about 0.5% of your total action.

### Why do I keep losing even with perfect basic strategy?
**Variance.** In a single session, anything can happen. Basic strategy is about long-term expected value, not short-term guarantees. You need hundreds or thousands of hands for the math to even out.

### Does basic strategy work for online blackjack?
Yes, IF the game isn't using a continuous shuffle machine. Most online RNG blackjack shuffles after every hand, making card counting impossible, but basic strategy still applies.

### Is basic strategy the same for all blackjack variations?
No. The chart changes based on specific rules (dealer hits soft 17, number of decks, double after split, surrender rules). The chart in this guide is for the most common 6-8 deck game with standard rules.

### Can casinos ban me for using basic strategy?
No. Basic strategy is legal and expected. Casinos only care if you're counting cards and betting accordingly. Using the chart is perfectly acceptable.

### What's the difference between basic strategy and card counting?
**Basic strategy** = optimal play assuming average remaining deck composition (0.5% house edge)

**Card counting** = tracking cards to know when deck is favorable, then betting more (1-2% player edge)

You must master basic strategy before learning to count cards.

### Should I take insurance or even money?
**No.** Insurance has a house edge of about 7% and is only profitable when you're counting cards and know the deck is rich in 10s. Even money is just insurance for your blackjack—also a bad bet.

### What if other players are making bad plays?
Ignore them. Other players' decisions **don't affect your long-term results**. Focus on playing perfect basic strategy regardless of what others do.

### Can I make money using only basic strategy?
Not in the long run. With a 0.5% house edge, you'll slowly lose money. However, basic strategy minimizes your losses and is required before moving on to advantage play techniques like card counting.
